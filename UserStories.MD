  * Detailed error messages for failed imports due to policy violations.


## 2. **Auto Renewal**

 **User Story #1** : As a  **system administrator** , I want to enable auto-renewal for certificates to ensure uninterrupted security and avoid certificate expirations that could cause outages.

## **3. Agentic Approach to Install Certificate**

* **Acceptance Criteria** :
  * Configurable agent installed on each server that checks for new certificates based on set intervals or triggers.
  * Agents can securely pull renewed certificates when available.
  * Real-time status updates for each server indicating certificate pull status.

## 3. Payment
